# nfc-tracker getting started

#To Do:
1. Sync / make separate mouse trackers for the visualizations so they don't leave off after each other (i.e. if you spin another graph and come back to the graph you were spinning, it will jump to a different viewing angle)

## Habits
- Use Google sheets
- Exported from Habit Bull
    - Theres just no good app with a straight forward api and ease of use
- Setup:
    - Have the "Habits" google sheet as a button on the home screen (imitating an app)
    - Have a recorded macro on google apps script to add the csv rows every day
        - This is so I do not have to manually copy and paste (the goal is as easy data collection as possible)
    - On the google apps script/recorded macro, there is an option to set the trigger to run daily.
        - This essentially adds my habits, ready for me to click a checkbox if I did them, every day.
